    "For my project I want to take a look at a data set that I found that was about wether a site is demmed trustworty or untrustworthy. I want to see if a machine learning algorithm could predict if a site that it is given would be trustworthy or untrustworthy. This would allow a program to classify if a site is trustworthy or not. This could help people browse the web easier if you were able to say, this site is a safe and trusted site."

    "In order to do this I will use both the relu and the tanh activation functions in order to train the network with the given data set. The data set is one found from the UCI Machine Learnign Repository called \"Dishonest Internet users Dataset Data Set\". The data has been put into a descret format. This means that given the proper range then the nerural net will be able to predict new site being trustworthy or untrustworthy based on statistics gathered from it. Then I will use the nerual net code used in class to build the neural net and use it to train the nerual net. Also I will need to format the data properly so that I can give the nerual net numbers to use for the learning. So this will end up being a classification problem"

Meaning that there was an element of weight already put onto the data given, so the nerual net will want to take in any and all data that it can. Then I am curious to see fi tanh or relu works better with the data.\n"
